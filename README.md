# .config Repository for SpeedMachine

This repository is a copy of the `.config` directory from an Ubuntu Linux host named `speedmachine`. It contains personal configuration files for various software applications. This repository is intended for personal use only, but it includes configurations for several programs that I have customized:

- **fish**: A smart and user-friendly command line shell.
- **kitty**: A fast, feature-rich, GPU-based terminal emulator.
- **i3wm**: A tiling window manager designed for advanced users.

Feel free to use any of these configurations if you happen to find this page. In the future, I plan to expand this list and add documentation to make these configurations easier to use.
